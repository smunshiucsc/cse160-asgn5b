    <p>Grader Notes: Shaun Munshi's Assignment 5b. I have made a 3D drawing of Minecraft steve, with
    two 3D spheres as the eyes, a diamond block as the nose, and a katana rotated as his smile. Along 
    that, I have 21 textured cubes of the different ores that make up his helmet. In addition, I added 3 types
    of lighting: Ambient, Directional, and Hemispherical lighting.</p>
